---------------------------
New Features in new version
---------------------------

+ polygonal dimensions

- effects
	effect="effect1 {speed=10,offset=10}; effect1 speed=10 offset=10;
			effect2; effect3, ..."


- add basic functions such as {effect, style, sound} and parameters parsing

- processing events in other thread
	- problem deleting control while event didn't get handled yet (event queue and event handling in other thread)
		; solve by mutexes, when control is deleted remove any existing things in queue

- changing styles on event

* textbox scrollbar
	; horizontal scrollbar is missing

* tooltips
	; tooltip="whatever text"
	; tooltip control which can be modified
	
+ Canvas layers and drawing functions
	; Canvas must be very fast, use update texture instead of GetTextureFromSurface ...
	; limit to 4 layers
	; pallete texture (determines which layer is used) => takes n bits per each layer
	; put line, circle, whatever into canvas
	; instant clear layer by incrementing value and clear layer can be spread to multiple clears so big clear spike each 255
	; special shader for rendering layered canvas
	
- gui caching
- anti-aliased line for canvas

---------------------------

- review textbox scrollbars

- docs
